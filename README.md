smac checker is a cross platform qr->server mobile app for android and ios. 

  - quick and dirty hack with less than decent exception handling
  
# How to compile!

  - You need Visual Studio or Xamarin Studio
  - The qr scanning component does not run in simulator, so physical devices are required




### Tech

smac checker uses these open source components:

* [Zxing] - Barcode Scanning Library for MonoTouch, Mono for Android, and Windows Phone
* [Newtonsoft.Json] - Json library
* [Xamarin.Forms] - Cross platform ui
* [Xam.Settings] - Cross platform configuration storage
